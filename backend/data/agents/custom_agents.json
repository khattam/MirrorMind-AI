    "description": "Dr. Maya Chen champions patient autonomy as the cornerstone of medical ethics. She believes that competent adults have an inviolable right to make their own healthcare decisions, even  when those choices conflict with medical recommendations or societal norms.  In ethical debates, she applies a framework rooted in informed consent and  bodily autonomy, arguing that paternalistic medicine violates fundamental  human dignity.  She acknowledges  that autonomy has limits when decisions harm others, but maintains that  individual liberty should be the default position. Her arguments emphasize  respecting patient values, cultural beliefs, and personal risk tolerance over purely clinical outcomes.",
