## What's This About?

You know those impossible ethical dilemmas that keep you up at 3 AM? The trolley problem? Self-driving car decisions? Whether to lie to save a life?

**MirrorMind lets AI agents fight it out for you.**

Submit a dilemma. Watch three AI agents with different moral frameworks debate it in real-time. See a judge score their arguments across five ethical dimensions. Then do it again with your own custom agents.

It's like a philosophical cage match, but with more citations and less blood.

---

## 🎯 Features

### 🥊 AI Debate Arena

Three philosophical heavyweights enter. One argument wins.

- **Deon** (The Deontologist) - "Rules are rules. Period."
- **Conse** (The Consequentialist) - "Show me the outcomes."
- **Virtue** (The Virtue Ethicist) - "What would a good person do?"

**How it works:**
1. You submit an ethical dilemma with two options
2. Each agent picks a side and argues for it
3. They go back and forth in structured rounds
4. A judge evaluates everything and declares a winner

**The cool part:** Watch them actually respond to each other's arguments. They're not just talking past each other—they're having a real debate.

### ✨ Agent Builder

Here's where it gets interesting. You can build your own ethical AI agents.

**The Process:**
1. **Name your agent** - "Dr. Maya Chen" or "The Utilitarian Robot" or whatever
2. **Pick an avatar** - 32 emoji options (🌱🔥💎🌊⚡🎭🦁🌙 and more)
3. **Write a description** - 50-1000 characters about their ethical framework
4. **Hit enhance** - GPT-4o transforms your description into a full philosophical framework

**What happens during enhancement:**
- Your 50-word idea becomes a 500-word ethical framework
- Adds concrete examples and case studies
- Cites actual philosophical works
- Structures their reasoning approach
- Scores quality across 4 dimensions

**Example transformation:**

```
BEFORE (your input):
"A doctor who believes in patient autonomy above all else."

AFTER (GPT-4o enhancement):
"Dr. Maya Chen champions patient autonomy as the cornerstone of medical 
ethics. She applies a framework rooted in informed consent and bodily 
autonomy, citing landmark cases like Cruzan v. Director to support her 
positions. When evaluating medical dilemmas, she prioritizes the patient's 
right to make their own healthcare decisions, even when those choices 
conflict with medical recommendations. Her approach acknowledges the 
tension between beneficence and autonomy, but she consistently argues 
that respecting patient agency is fundamental to ethical care."
```

**Quality Scoring:**
- **Clarity** - Is it readable and well-structured?
- **Completeness** - Does it have all the key elements?
- **Specificity** - Concrete examples vs vague statements?
- **Consistency** - Does the logic hold together?

Each dimension scored 0-10. You can regenerate until you're happy with it.

### 📊 Analytics Dashboard

Because what's the point of debates if you can't track who's winning?

**Metrics tracked:**
- Total debates conducted
- Win rates by agent
- Average scores per ethical dimension
- Most debated dilemmas
- Debate history with full transcripts

**The judge scores every debate across 5 dimensions:**
- 🛡️ **Harm Minimization** - Does it reduce suffering?
- 📜 **Rule Consistency** - Does it follow moral principles?
- 🗽 **Autonomy Respect** - Does it honor individual choice?
- 💎 **Honesty** - Does it involve truthfulness?
- ⚖️ **Fairness** - Does it treat people equally?

Each option gets 0-2 points per dimension. Highest total wins.

---

### ⚖️ The Judge

An impartial AI that:
- Analyzes all arguments from both sides
- Scores each option across 5 ethical dimensions
- Declares a winner with confidence level
- Explains its reasoning in detail

No bias. No favorites. Just cold, hard ethical analysis.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### The Fun Stuff

**Frontend:**
- React 18 because hooks are life
- Vite because waiting for builds is for chumps
- Pure CSS because we don't need no stinking UI library
- Custom animations because smooth is smooth

**Backend:**
- FastAPI because async/await is beautiful
- Python 3.8+ with type hints because we're not animals
- Pydantic for validation because data should make sense
- JSON files because sometimes simple is better

**AI Magic:**
- **Groq API** with Llama 3.3 70B for debates (fast as hell)
- **OpenAI GPT-4o** for agent enhancement (quality over speed)
- Structured JSON output because we like predictable responses
- Error handling with fallbacks because AI is weird sometimes

**Deployment:**
- Vercel for frontend (auto-deploy from GitHub)
- Render for backend (free tier that actually works)
- GitHub Actions for uptime (pings every 5 minutes)
- Vercel Analytics because we like knowing who visits
